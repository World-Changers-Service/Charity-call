## 📖 Overview

**Charicall** is an open-source, full-stack charity donation platform that connects compassionate donors with verified humanitarian causes. Unlike generic fundraising platforms, Charicall is built around **cause categories** — giving donors full clarity on exactly what their money supports.

Every donation on Charicall is:
- **Transparent** — tracked from submission to disbursement
- **Categorised** — attributed to a specific, verified humanitarian cause
- **Accountable** — managed by verified organisations with admin oversight

The platform serves three actors: **donors** who give, **organisations** (NGOs, charities, foundations) who manage causes and withdraw funds, and **administrators** who verify organisations and oversee platform integrity.

---

## 💛 Mission Statement

> _"We believe that giving should be simple, trustworthy, and meaningful. Charicall exists to remove the friction between compassion and action — so that anyone, anywhere, can direct their generosity to where it matters most."_

Charicall is built with the conviction that every dollar donated deserves to be tracked, every cause deserves verification, and every donor deserves confidence that their contribution is making a real difference.

---

## 🗂️ Cause Categories

Charicall organises charitable causes into the following primary categories. Each category contains multiple individual causes created and managed by verified organisations.

| Icon | Category | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 🌊 | **Relief Funds** | Emergency and general humanitarian aid for communities facing poverty, famine, earthquakes, floods, and other crises. Funds are disbursed rapidly to maximise impact. |
| 🎗️ | **Cancer Patients** | Financial support covering treatment costs, chemotherapy, palliative care, psychological support, and cancer research grants for patients who cannot afford care. |
| 🌀 | **Hurricane Victims** | Rapid-response relief for individuals and families whose homes, livelihoods, and communities have been devastated by hurricanes, cyclones, and tropical storms. |
| 🎀 | **HIV / AIDS** | Programmes targeting treatment access (ARVs), awareness campaigns, education initiatives, stigma reduction, orphan support, and long-term care for those living with HIV/AIDS. |

> **Note for administrators:** New categories can be created through the admin panel as global humanitarian needs evolve. All categories require admin approval before going live on the platform.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Charicall follows a **monorepo structure** with three major subsystems — a REST API backend, a web frontend, and a smart contract layer.

```

### Backend Architecture (NestJS)

The backend follows NestJS's **modular architecture pattern**. Each domain is encapsulated in its own module with its own controllers, services, DTOs, and entities.

```

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### How it Works

Charicall uses **JWT Bearer tokens** for authentication.

1. The client sends credentials to `POST /api/auth/login`
2. On success, the server returns an `access_token` (short-lived) and `refresh_token` (long-lived)
3. The client includes `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` on subsequent requests
4. Expired access tokens can be refreshed at `POST /api/auth/refresh`

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

| Role | Who | Access |
|---|---|---|
| `donor` | Registered donors | Browse causes, donate, view own history |
| `organisation` | Verified NGOs / charities | Manage their own causes and withdrawal requests |
| `admin` | Platform administrators | Full platform access, moderation, analytics |

Guards at the route level enforce RBAC. Attempting to access a higher-privilege route returns `403 Forbidden`.

### Password Security
- Passwords are hashed with **bcrypt** (salt rounds: 12) before storage
- Plain-text passwords are **never stored or logged**

## 💸 Donation Flow

```
Donor selects a Cause
        │
        ▼
Donor submits donation amount
        │
        ▼
POST /api/donations
  → Donation record created (status: pending)
  → Payment initiated via payment provider (Stripe/Paystack)
        │
        ├── Payment SUCCESS
        │       → Donation status → successful
        │       → Cause.raisedAmount updated
        │       → Receipt email sent to donor
        │       → Organisation notified
        │
        └── Payment FAILURE
                → Donation status → failed
                → Donor notified with error details
```

---

## 🐳 Running with Docker

> Docker support coming soon. The following is the planned `docker-compose.yml` setup.

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  api:
    build: ./Backend
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - DB_HOST=db
    depends_on:
      - db

  db:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: charicall
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
    volumes:
      - pg_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"

volumes:
  pg_data:
```

Run with:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are co-located with their source files (`*.spec.ts`). They test individual services and utilities in isolation using mocked dependencies.

```bash
npm run test
```

### End-to-End Tests

E2e tests are located in the `test/` directory and test full request/response cycles against a real test database.

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Coverage

```bash
npm run test:cov
```

Coverage reports are generated in `.coverage/`. Aim for >80% coverage across services.

---

## 🚢 Deployment

### Environment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- [ ] Use a strong, unique `JWT_SECRET`
- [ ] Set `DB_*` to point to a managed/cloud PostgreSQL instance
- [ ] Configure SMTP credentials for transactional emails
- [ ] Set `FRONTEND_URL` to your deployed frontend domain
- [ ] Disable TypeORM `synchronize` (use migrations instead)

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

### Recommended Hosting

| Layer | Recommended Platform |
|---|---|
| Backend API | Railway, Render, AWS ECS, Heroku |
| Database | Supabase, Neon, AWS RDS, Railway Postgres |

## 🔒 Security

Charicall takes security seriously. The following measures are implemented or planned:

| Area | Measure |
|---|---|
| Authentication | JWT with short expiry + refresh token rotation |
| Passwords | bcrypt with salt rounds ≥ 12 |
| Input validation | `class-validator` on all DTOs — whitelist mode enabled |
| SQL injection | All queries via TypeORM parameterised queries |
| Rate limiting | `@nestjs/throttler` on auth and donation endpoints |
| CORS | Restricted to frontend origin via `FRONTEND_URL` |
| Secrets management | All secrets loaded via environment variables, never hardcoded |
| HTTPS | Enforced at infrastructure/reverse proxy level (Nginx / load balancer) |
| XSS | Output sanitisation on user-provided content |

> **Found a security vulnerability?** Please disclose it privately to `security@charicall.org` — do not open a public issue.
